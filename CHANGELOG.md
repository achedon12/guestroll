# Changelog

Every release, what changed for the people who run Guestroll and the people who
use it. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release's
notes on GitHub are this file's section for it.

**Upgrading** sections list what to check before updating. Database migrations
always run on their own at startup; take a backup first all the same
(Admin → Settings → Data).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- German (`de`): the guest page, the admin and the emails.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-17

### Security

- A video's length is measured from what actually plays, not from the length
  its header announces: an edited header could slip a video of several
  minutes past `MAX_VIDEO_SECONDS`.
- The limit of 4 videos received at once holds for the whole server, however
  many times its code is loaded.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- Videos, per event and off by default: guests film or pick short clips
  (`MAX_VIDEO_SECONDS`, 60 s by default, and `MAX_VIDEO_MB`, 200 MB), kept as
  filmed. The phone draws the poster frame and checks the length before
  sending; the server checks the container and the length again, and streams
  the video to disk instead of memory. Videos play in the album, the shared
  album and gallery links, muted on the wall, and go in the ZIP and the cloud
  export with their own extension. With moderation on, a pending video is
  approved once the host has watched it: its poster comes from the guest's
  phone and may not match.
- Photos still waiting to be sent are kept in the guest's browser: a phone
  locked, an app switched or a tab closed mid-upload sends them on the next
  visit, from the table they were taken at, instead of losing them.

### Upgrading

- If your events will accept videos, raise your reverse proxy's body size
  limit above `MAX_VIDEO_MB` (200 MB by default).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added

- Shared album, per event and off by default: guests can also see the others'
  approved photos, during and after the event or only once it is over. Never
  pending or hidden photos, never the others' originals.
- QR codes per table or place: each with the event's design and the place's
  name, photos sent after scanning one are tagged with it, with a filter in the
  Photos tab and a count per place in Stats.
- Photo booth: a link for a tablet on a stand, with the live camera full
  screen, a countdown and the event's frame; the photo goes straight into the
  album. Revocable, no per-guest limit.
- Blurry photos and duplicates are spotted on the server from the pixels (no
  outside service) and shown as filters in moderation; photos already in the
  album are analysed in the background.
- Invite co-organizers by email: a single-use link, valid 7 days, where they
  pick their own username and password; revocable, and shown to copy when
  email isn't set up.
- Printable album: a PDF with a cover and the photos (or the favorites), 1, 2
  or 4 per A4 page with credits, from the originals for one per page.
- Cloud export over WebDAV (Nextcloud, ownCloud, Synology, kDrive…): one
  folder per event, sent in the background with its progress, by hand or
  automatically when the event ends.
- Single sign-on with any OpenID Connect provider (Authentik, Authelia,
  Keycloak…): `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Prometheus metrics at `/api/metrics`, behind `METRICS_TOKEN`.

### Changed

- An event's settings tab: an outline that follows the page, what each section
  is for, the frame picked from previews, the save bar only when something
  changed (with *Discard*, and a warning before leaving), and duplicating and
  deleting laid out like the rest.

### Fixed

- The live wall's mosaic and grid showed photos cropped to a square (frames
  and edges cut off): they are now shown whole, over a blurred copy that fills
  the tile.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-15

### Upgrading

- Webhooks to an address on your own network (ntfy, Home Assistant) now need
  `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true`.
- An SMTP server with a user and no TLS at all now needs
  `SMTP_ALLOW_PLAIN=true`.

### Added

- Guests can delete their own photos, from the photo itself, at any time.
- The documentation website: every release's docs with a version switcher and
  search, and the wiki generated from the same files.

- Two-step verification (authenticator app codes) for admin accounts, with
  recovery codes; owners can reset it for a lost phone.

- Scheduled backups (node-cron) to a folder or an S3 bucket, with rotation,
  a list to download or restore from, and an alert when one fails.

- Update notifications: the admin shows new releases with their notes; owners
  get an email and a webhook once per version.
- One-click updates from the admin with the optional updater container: a
  backup, the new image, a health check, automatic rollback, and an update
  history listing the migrations each update applied.

- Demo mode (`DEMO_MODE=true`): seeded events, a shared account, a nightly
  reset, nothing sent out. `docker-compose.demo.yml` runs one.

### Changed

- Settings are split into five areas (account, team, notifications, data,
  system), each a page of its own; the list says which area needs attention:
  two-step verification off, no automatic backups, no email server, an update
  waiting.
- The language picker lists each language under its own name with its name in
  the current language beside it ("Italiano, italien"), works from the
  keyboard, and opens upwards near the bottom of the screen. The event form's
  default language reads the same way.
- The events list is paged (20 per page) with a search that filters as you
  type; photo counts are only computed for the events on screen, so the
  dashboard and the list stay fast with hundreds of events.
  `GET /api/admin/events` takes `page`, `perPage` and `q`.

### Security

- A HEIC photo is refused above `MAX_IMAGE_MEGAPIXELS` before it is decoded: a
  small crafted file could declare a huge image and exhaust the server's memory.
  HEIC is decoded straight into sharp, without a JPEG round trip.
- Guest uploads and guestbook messages are also limited per event and per
  address, uploads being received share a memory budget counted in bytes,
  at most 3 images are decoded at once with 12 waiting (guests' phones retry
  on their own) and uploads stop when the disk has less than
  512 MB free: a script dropping its cookie was a new guest with a fresh
  budget every time.
- Wrong access codes, gallery passwords and admin passwords are counted before
  they are checked, so parallel guesses can't slip past the limits; a
  successful sign-in no longer clears the limit for other accounts.
- Webhooks can't reach private, loopback or link-local addresses, however
  they are written and whatever a name resolves to at connection time, unless
  `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true`.
- The saved SMTP password is dropped when the server or account changes, and
  the login is only sent over TLS (`SMTP_ALLOW_PLAIN=true` for a local relay).
- An owner's own password changes only from their account page, with the
  current one.
- A demo instance sends no email or webhook, whatever triggers it.
- `Strict-Transport-Security` when `PUBLIC_URL` is `https://`.
- Account email addresses are checked with a bounded pattern: the previous one
  could be made to backtrack for minutes.
- Every page carries a nonce-based Content-Security-Policy.
- Photo compression no longer loads a worker script from a CDN: guests'
  browsers never contact a third party.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added

- **Several admin accounts.** Owners run the instance; organizers only see the
  events assigned to them and can't delete them. Accounts get a generated
  password, shown once.
- **S3-compatible storage** for photos, logos and voice notes (AWS, R2, B2,
  Garage, RustFS…), next to the local folder.
- **Favorites**: star photos, download the favorites as a ZIP, share a gallery
  link limited to them.
- **Photo challenges** guests pick before shooting, with their progress and
  per-challenge stats.
- **Guestbook**: written messages and voice notes for the hosts, moderated,
  exported as a ZIP.
- **Live wall layouts**: one print, a mosaic or a grid, with names, challenges,
  guestbook messages and the QR code in a corner.
- **Duplicate an event** with its settings, look, logo and organizers.
- **Import the photographer's photos** at full quality.
- **Webhooks**: alerts to ntfy, Discord, Slack or a signed JSON endpoint.
- **Backup and restore** from the admin, and automatic deletion of ended events
  after a chosen delay.
- **Frames and filters** drawn on the phone before sending.
- **Slideshow video**: an MP4 of the album, made in the browser.

### Fixed

- Emails and webhooks queued in the same second kept no order.

### Security

- Guest text reaching Slack and Discord notices is escaped: no mentions or
  disguised links.

### Upgrading

- Sign-in now asks for a username. Your existing password becomes the `admin`
  account (or `ADMIN_USERNAME`); signing in with the password alone still works.
- Events, photos and settings are kept; new tables are created at startup.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added

- **Email** through your SMTP server, set by environment variables or in the
  admin with an encrypted password and a test button.
- **Admin alerts**: photos waiting for approval, an event's summary, failed
  sign-ins, disk almost full.
- **End of the event**: guests who left their address get a gallery link; you
  get a summary. On schedule or with *End the event now*.
- **Gallery links** protected by a password, with an expiry and a downloads
  switch.

### Upgrading

- Events that had already closed are marked as ended, so no end-of-event email
  goes out for past parties.
- New optional variables: `SMTP_*`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-15

Tagged but never published as an image (its release build stalled and was
cancelled): these changes reached Docker Hub and GHCR with 0.2.0.

### Added

- An install kit (`docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`) attached to every
  release.

### Security

- The image drops the system font packages and their expat vulnerabilities:
  no known CVE left in the image.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-15

First release.

- Guests scan a QR code, the camera opens, photos upload over weak connections
  and only their author sees them.
- Admin: events, moderation, ZIP download, stats, a live wall, a printable
  table card.
- QR code designer with scan-tested presets, logo and caption.
- English, French, Italian and Spanish; light and dark themes.
- One multi-arch Docker image with a `/data` volume.
