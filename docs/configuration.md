# Configuration

Guestroll is configured with environment variables only. Every variable is
optional: an empty instance starts with safe defaults. A complete template is in
[`.env.example`](../.env.example).

Invalid values stop the server at startup with a message naming the variable,
instead of running with a silent fallback.

## Docker and network

These are read by the container or by `docker-compose.yml`, not by the app itself.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the server listens on inside the container (or on the machine without Docker). The health check follows it. |
| `HOSTNAME` | `0.0.0.0` | Interface the server binds to inside the container. |
| `HOST_PORT` | `3000` | Compose only: port published on the host. |
| `HOST_BIND` | `0.0.0.0` | Compose only: host interface to publish on. `127.0.0.1` keeps Guestroll reachable only through a local reverse proxy. |
| `DATA_PATH` | `guestroll-data` | Compose only: named volume or host path mounted on `/data`. |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | `1001` | User and group that own the data folder and run the server. Match your host user for bind mounts. |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Time zone of the stats (hourly and daily buckets), e.g. `Europe/Paris`. |
| `GUESTROLL_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/achedon12/guestroll:latest` | Compose only: image to run. Pin a version in production. |
| `CONTAINER_NAME` | `guestroll` | Compose only: lets you run several instances side by side. |

## Instance

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_NAME` | `Guestroll` | Shown in page titles, the admin header and social cards. |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | *(request host)* | Public origin encoded in QR codes and social cards, e.g. `https://photos.example.com`. Set it: behind a proxy, the request host may be an internal name. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` (`/data` in Docker) | Where the SQLite database and photos live. |

## Languages

Guestroll speaks English (`en`), French (`fr`), Italian (`it`), Spanish (`es`) and German (`de`).
Each visitor gets, in this order:

1. the language they picked with the language menu (kept in their browser);
2. the album's language, if the hosts set one in the event settings;
3. their browser's language, if supported and `DETECT_BROWSER_LOCALE` is on;
4. `DEFAULT_LOCALE`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_LOCALE` | `en` | Language used when nothing more specific applies. |
| `DETECT_BROWSER_LOCALE` | `true` | `false` skips step 3: everyone without a choice gets the album's language or `DEFAULT_LOCALE`. |

## Security

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Username of the owner account created on first start. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(generated)* | Password of that owner account. When set, it wins on every start (and the account stays an owner): it is the way back in if every other password is lost. When empty, a password is generated on first start and printed once in the logs; change it in **Admin → Settings**. Other accounts are created from the admin. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | *(generated)* | Key that signs and encrypts cookies, 32+ characters. When empty, one is generated and stored in `DATA_DIR/.session-secret`. Changing it signs everyone out. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Read the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` and the host from `X-Forwarded-Host`. Turn it on **only** behind a reverse proxy you control, or rate limits can be dodged with a forged header. |
| `SECURE_COOKIES` | `true` in production | Cookies only travel over HTTPS. Set to `false` only to test over plain HTTP on a local network. |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | `false` | Let webhooks reach private, loopback and link-local addresses (a self-hosted ntfy or Home Assistant on your network). Off, a webhook to such an address fails with a message saying so: an owner's webhook can't probe the server's own network or cloud metadata. |
| `CLOUD_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | `false` | Let the cloud export reach a WebDAV server on your own network (a Nextcloud at home). Off, such an address is refused, like for webhooks. |

## Metrics

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | | Turns on `/api/metrics` for Prometheus, behind `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (16 characters or more). Without it, or with a wrong token, the endpoint answers `404`. |

A scrape job:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: guestroll
    scheme: https
    metrics_path: /api/metrics
    authorization:
      credentials: <METRICS_TOKEN>
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["photos.example.com"]
```

It reports events (total, open), photos by status and their size, guests,
guestbook messages, the email, webhook and cloud export queues, the photos'
disk, the last scheduled backup, the version, memory and uptime. Nothing that
names an event or a person.

## Single sign-on

Sign in with Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak, Google Workspace or any OpenID
Connect provider. In the provider, create a confidential client with the
redirect URL `https://<your PUBLIC_URL>/api/admin/oidc/callback` and the
scopes `openid email profile`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | | The provider's issuer URL, e.g. `https://auth.example.com/application/o/guestroll`. Single sign-on is on when the three first variables are set. |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | | |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | | |
| `OIDC_NAME` | `SSO` | What the button says: *Sign in with Authentik*. |
| `OIDC_AUTO_CREATE` | `false` | Someone the provider knows but Guestroll doesn't gets an organizer account without events (an owner then gives them some). Off, they're refused until an owner invites them. |
| `OIDC_LINK_BY_EMAIL` | `false` | A first sign-in links the organizer account with the same verified email. Only for a provider where people can't change their own email: many let them, and still call it verified. Owner accounts are never linked this way. |

Each person links their identity once, from **Settings → Your account →
Single sign-on**, signed in and typing their password again: that proves they
hold both. Changing the password unlinks it (relink it afterwards).
After that, *Sign in with …* signs them in. Password sign-in stays available.
An account with two-step verification still asks for its code after the
provider.

## Uploads

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `25` | Largest accepted photo. Phones resize before sending, so most uploads weigh 1–4 MB. Raise your reverse proxy's body limit above this. |
| `MAX_IMAGE_MEGAPIXELS` | `80` | Images above this are refused before decoding, which protects memory from "decompression bombs". |
| `MAX_VIDEO_MB` | `200` | Largest accepted video, for events that take videos. Videos are kept as filmed, never re-encoded: a phone films about 2 MB a second in 1080p, 6 in 4K. Raise your reverse proxy's body limit above this too. |
| `MAX_VIDEO_SECONDS` | `60` | Longest accepted video. Checked on the phone before sending, and again by the server. |
| `DEFAULT_CAPTURE_MODE` | `camera` | Capture mode preselected for new events: `camera`, `picker` or `both`. |

## Rate limits

Per minute. Upload limits apply per guest, login limits per client IP.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RATE_LIMIT_UPLOADS_PER_MINUTE` | `30` | Photos one guest can send per minute. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_PER_MINUTE` | `5` | Admin login attempts per IP. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_UNLOCK_PER_MINUTE` | `10` | Access-code attempts per guest; three times this value is the ceiling for wrong codes on one event, across all guests. |

## Storage

Photos, logos and voice messages go to a folder under `DATA_DIR` by default.
Set `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` to keep them in any S3-compatible bucket instead (AWS
S3, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, Garage, RustFS, SeaweedFS…). The
SQLite database always stays in `DATA_DIR`, so keep the volume either way.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `STORAGE_DRIVER` | `local` | `local` or `s3`. |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | *(none)* | e.g. `https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com`, `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, `http://garage:3900`. |
| `S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Region used to sign requests. Most self-hosted servers accept the default. |
| `S3_BUCKET` | *(none)* | The bucket must exist. Keep it **private**: Guestroll serves every file itself, after checking access. |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | *(none)* | Credentials allowed to read, write, list and delete in the bucket. |
| `S3_PREFIX` | *(none)* | Folder inside the bucket, to share one bucket between instances. |
| `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | `true` | `true` sends `endpoint/bucket/key`; `false` sends `bucket.endpoint/key` (AWS virtual-hosted style). |

At startup Guestroll writes, reads back and deletes a small probe file, and
logs `[storage] S3 bucket NOT usable` with the reason if that fails. Files are
never served from the bucket directly, so photos stay private even with a
bucket on a public endpoint. To move existing photos to a bucket, make a backup
(Admin → Settings → Data), switch the driver, then restore it.

## Scheduled backups

Owners set them in **Admin → Settings → Data**; these variables
set them from the environment instead (the admin then shows them read-only).
Each backup is the same ZIP as a manual one: database, every photo, logo and
voice note, and the generated session secret.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKUP_CRON` | *(none)* | Turns scheduled backups on, e.g. `0 3 * * *` (every night at 3:00, in `TZ`). Five fields. |
| `BACKUP_KEEP` | `7` | How many backups to keep; older ones are deleted after each new one. |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `DATA_DIR/backups` | Where they go. Mount another disk here: a backup on the same disk as the photos doesn't survive that disk. |
| `BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT`, `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`, `BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `BACKUP_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `BACKUP_S3_REGION`, `BACKUP_S3_PREFIX`, `BACKUP_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | *(none)* | Send them to an S3-compatible bucket instead of a folder (`BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` set). Use another bucket than the photos'. Large archives go up in 16 MB parts. |

A failed backup emails the owners and the instance address, and notifies
webhooks subscribed to *A scheduled backup failed*.

## Demo

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_MODE` | `false` | A public demo: seeded content, the `demo` account, nightly reset, nothing sent out. See [Deployment](deployment.md#a-public-demo). |
| `DEMO_RESET_CRON` | `0 4 * * *` | When the demo goes back to its seed, in `TZ`. |

## Updates

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `UPDATE_CHECK` | `true` | Ask GitHub every 12 hours for the latest release and tell the owners about new ones. `false` makes no outbound call. |
| `UPDATER_URL` | *(none)* | Where the updater container answers, `http://updater:9900` with the bundled compose file. Turns on one-click updates. |
| `UPDATER_TOKEN` | *(none)* | A long random secret shared by the app and the updater (24+ characters). |

The updater itself reads `UPDATER_TOKEN`, `UPDATER_CONTAINER` (the container to
replace, `guestroll` by default) and `UPDATER_PORT` (`9900`). See
[Deployment](deployment.md#upgrades).

## Email

Optional. Without SMTP, everything else works and no email is ever sent.
SMTP can also be set in **Admin → Settings → Notifications**, where the password is
stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM, key derived from `SESSION_SECRET`). When
`SMTP_HOST` is set, the environment wins and the admin form is read-only.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | *(none)* | SMTP server, e.g. `smtp.fastmail.com`. Setting it turns email on. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | `587` (STARTTLS) or `465` (TLS). |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `false` | `true` for implicit TLS on port 465. |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` | *(none)* | Credentials, when the server asks for them. |
| `SMTP_FROM` | `SMTP_USER` | Sender, e.g. `Guestroll <photos@example.com>`. |
| `SMTP_ALLOW_PLAIN` | `false` | With a user set, the login is only sent once the connection is encrypted (implicit TLS or STARTTLS), so nobody on the path can strip STARTTLS and read it. `true` for a relay without TLS on the same machine or a trusted network. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | *(none)* | Where alerts and event summaries go. Settable in the admin when empty. |
| `SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | How often the background worker sends queued mail, closes scheduled events and checks alerts. `0` turns it off. |

Emails wait in a queue in the database and are retried after 1, 5, 15 minutes,
1 and 6 hours, then marked failed (Admin → Settings shows them, with a retry
button). Set `PUBLIC_URL`: links in emails are built from it, since a
background job has no request to read the host from.
