# Guestroll

**Every guest's photos, in one place.**
Guests scan a QR code, their camera opens, and every picture lands in your private album.
Self-hosted. No app to install, no account to create.

---

At a wedding, a birthday or a company party, the best photos end up scattered
across a hundred phones and never get shared. Guestroll fixes that with one QR
code on each table:

1. **Scan.** The guest's phone opens a page, not an app store.
2. **Shoot.** The camera opens straight away. One tap, and the photo is sent.
3. **Done.** It's in your album, with the guest's name, ready to download as a ZIP.

You run it yourself, on your own server, with one Docker command. The photos
never leave your machine.

## Watch the tour

<a href="https://youtu.be/MEuvBB-wVI8"><img src="docs/assets/video-thumbnail.png" alt="Guestroll presentation video on YouTube, about three minutes" width="640" /></a>

Three minutes: a guest taking photos, the hosts' admin, the QR code designer, the live wall, and installing it.

## Features

**For guests**
- 📷 Camera opens directly from the QR code. iPhone and Android, no install.
- 🔁 Uploads keep going on a weak 4G connection: resized on the phone, queued, retried, resumed when back online, and kept on the phone until sent, even if the guest closes the page.
- 🎬 **Videos**, if the hosts turn them on: short clips filmed or picked from the library, kept as filmed, played in the album and on the wall.
- 🙋 Optional name prompt so the hosts know who took what.
- 🖼️ **Frames and filters** applied on the phone: an instant-print border with the event name, the event's color, or a logo stamp; black & white, warm, vintage, vivid.
- 📝 **Guestbook**: a few words or a voice note for the hosts, moderated, exported as a ZIP.
- 🎯 **Photo challenges**: prompts guests pick before shooting ("The dance floor", "The cake"), with their progress.
- 🔒 Guests see their own photos and can delete them; the hosts decide whether to share the album with everyone. The album belongs to the hosts.
- 🌍 English, French, Italian, Spanish and German, picked from the phone's language, switchable on the page.
- 🌗 Light and dark themes.

**For hosts**
- 🗂️ As many events as you want, each with its own link, QR code and accent color; duplicate one to start next year's.
- 📥 Import the photographer's shots into the same album.
- 👥 **Several admin accounts**: owners run everything, organizers only the events you give them.
- 🔐 Optional access code per event, so a QR code shared on social media isn't enough.
- ✅ Moderation: publish right away and hide later, or approve each photo first.
- ⭐ **Favorites**: star your picks for a "best of" ZIP, or a gallery link that only shows them.
- 📺 **Live wall** for a projector or TV: one print at a time, a mosaic or a grid, with names, challenges, guestbook messages and the QR code in a corner.
- 🎨 **QR code designer**: colors, dot and corner shapes, your logo in the middle, a caption. Every preset is scan-tested.
- 🖨️ Printable A4 table card, plus PNG (up to 4096 px) and SVG exports.
- 🗣️ A default language per album, for a wedding in Italy with Italian guests.
- ⏰ Uploads close on a schedule, with an optional per-guest photo limit.
- 📦 One-click ZIP of the whole album, streamed (works for albums of several GB).
- 🎬 **Slideshow video**: an MP4 of the album with transitions and your music, made in the browser, 16:9 or 9:16.
- 📊 Stats: uploads over time, views, downloads, storage, top photographers.
- 🔑 **Gallery links**: a private link + password to the album, for family or for guests afterwards. Expiry, view-only or downloads, revocable.
- ✉️ **Automatic emails** through your SMTP server: when uploads close, a summary for you and the album link for guests who asked for it. You choose what goes out.
- 🔔 Admin alerts by email or **webhook** (ntfy, Discord, Slack, signed JSON for Home Assistant): photos waiting for approval, new guestbook messages, failed sign-ins, disk almost full.

**For whoever runs the server**
- 🐳 A single container, multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`, so a Raspberry Pi works too).
- 🗃️ No external database: SQLite plus a folder of files in one volume, or photos in any **S3-compatible bucket** (AWS, R2, B2, Garage…).
- 🛡️ Private by design: photos are never public files, and every request is checked. See [Security](docs/security.md).
- 🧩 **Swappable capture component**: ship your own camera UI without touching the upload code. See [Customization](docs/customization.md).
- 💾 **Backup and restore** from the admin in one ZIP, and automatic deletion of ended events after a delay you choose.
- ⚙️ Configured with environment variables: port, data path, `PUID`/`PGID`, time zone, limits.

## Quick start

```bash
docker run -d --name guestroll \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v guestroll-data:/data \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-long-password' \
  -e PUBLIC_URL='https://photos.example.com' \
  ghcr.io/achedon12/guestroll:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin`, sign in, create an event and print its QR code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phone browsers only open the camera on **HTTPS** pages. Put Guestroll behind a
> reverse proxy with a certificate before the event. The
> [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) has copy-paste setups for Caddy, Traefik
> and nginx.

### With Docker Compose

Every [release](https://github.com/achedon12/guestroll/releases/latest) has an
install kit, `guestroll-vX.Y.Z-compose.zip`: a `docker-compose.yml` pinned to
that version and a commented `.env.example`. The same files are in this
repository.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in at least `PUBLIC_URL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
2. Start it: `docker compose up -d`
3. Open `PUBLIC_URL/admin`, sign in as `admin`, create an event and print its QR code.

Every setting is described in [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).
Sign in at `/admin` as `admin`. Forgot to set `ADMIN_PASSWORD`? A password is
generated on first start and printed once in `docker logs guestroll`.
